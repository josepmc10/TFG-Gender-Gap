# Analysing the gender gap in online services: the case of private tutors

### Josep Moncl√∫s Carrasco

Here you can find the release of the data and code that I have created during my TFG

## Tutors data

You can find it by unziping the file data.zip

I have created a dataset with more than 10k rows of information about Spanish tutors from web pages using web scrapping. All information is anonymised through database anonymisation processes. 

## Fair-Analysis

All the code from the fair-analysis is released too in this repository, for more information you can contact direct to me.
